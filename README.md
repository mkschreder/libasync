Kernel Architecture
===================

LibK is a lightweight kernel that implements cooperative multitasking using async/await in C and C++. It is a technique that allows you to have methods that can sleep and resume. This also allows for async processes and work queues that allow you to run multiple async tasks in parallel and in series. 

Asynchronous Programming in C and C++ 
-------------------------------------

The C and C++ languages have been originally designed during a time when people have not had much grasp on asynchronous patterns. It is only recently that asynchronous patterns have become more mainstream with the advent of languages that support asynchronous programming natively. Web developers in particular have become very accustomed with asynchronous patterns because all of web browser scripting is asynchronous.

But in the C and C++ world we have been lagging behind. There has not been a technique around that would allow for coding patterns where methods would take several frames to complete. This is not at all the same as threads - it is a whole new way of writing code. In fact, we can't even implement this with threads because it is quite a different concept. 

What we want is ability to do this: 
	
	async method(argument){
		sleep(100); // async sleep 
		...
		printf("%s\n", argument); 
	}
	await method("test"); 
	printf("blah\n"); 
	
and the result should be this: 
	blah
	.. delay 
	test
	
See the difference? We want the async method to never block. This technique is extremely useful for complex processes inside an application that actually need to sleep and then continue after a delay but it should not halt the whole application - only the method that sleeps. 

We can implement this if only we could have a technique to pause a method and then resume it. Luckily we have such a technique, in fact two of them: one is switch statements that can jump arbitrarily even into loops, the other is address labels which are even better because they can jump anywhere inside a function without requiring the function to start from the top. 

One important side effect of async methods is that they can not have any local variables - and in fact, they should not! You should instead always declare all variables that are used inside async methods outside of them - for example inside a structure which the async method is a member of. 

Async processes and methods
---------------------------

There are two main types of constructs in the async library: the processes and the methods. Processes are more heavy weight because they also maintain data structures to allow them to be chained into lists of tasks. Methods on the other hand are extremely lightweight. 

Processes can be stacked into queues. 

	// initialize a process structure
	ASYNC_PROCESS_INIT(&process_struct, process_method); 
	// link process structure to a queue
	ASYNC_QUEUE_WORK(&process_queue, &process_struct); 
	..
	// run the queue once
	ASYNC_RUN_PARALLEL(&process_queue); 
	..
	// normally you would do this though: 
	AWAIT(ASYNC_RUN_PARALLEL(&process_queue)); 
	// .. or this: 
	AWAIT(ASYNC_RUN_SERIES(&process_queue)); 
	// both of which asynchronously wait for all processes 
	// to complete before your code continues. 
	
Methods are lightweight and can not be stacked - but you can have many of them because they are light-weight. 

Both processes and threads must always contain following two statements: 
	
	ASYNC_BEGIN(); 
	// and 
	ASYNC_END(return_value); 

C processes are defined like this: 
	
	ASYNC_PROCESS(process_name){
		ASYNC_BEGIN(); 
		// ... code
		ASYNC_END(0); // processes always return int
	}

.. and used like this: 
	
	ASYNC_QUEUE(queue); 
	struct async_process proc; 
	
	ASYNC_PROCESS_INIT(&proc, process_name); 
	ASYNC_QUEUE_WORK(&queue, &proc); 
	
C async methods are defined like this: 

	// prototypes can be defined like this: 
	ASYNC_PROTOTYPE(const char*, mystruct_t, method_name, 
		char *arg, int arg2); 
	// implementations like this: 
	ASYNC(const char*, mystruct_t, method_name, 
		char *arg, int arg2){
		ASYNC_BEGIN(); 
		ASYNC_END("result string"); 
	}

First argument is return type, second is struct which contains data for this method. Third is the method name and then you can write all the arguments. 

You can then define you struct like this: 

	struct mystruct {
		// this is data - must be same name as the method above. 
		struct async_task method_name; 
		struct async_process process; 
		// some other struct data 
		const char *str; 
	}; 
	// typedef because only single words can be used in C macros
	typedef struct mystruct mystruct_t; 
	ASYNC(int, mystruct_t, method_name){
		// async methods always get __self parameter which points to 
		// structure of type mystruct_t (in this case) 
		struct mystruct *self = __self; 
		ASYNC_BEGIN(); 
		// use the struct data
		printf("%s\n", self->str); 
		ASYNC_END(0); 
	}

	ASYNC_PROCESS(mystruct_process){
		// retreive the struct itself 
		struct mystruct *self = container_of(__self, struct mystruct, process); 
		ASYNC_BEGIN(); 
		// wait for our task. It takes parameter of type mystruct_t*
		AWAIT_TASK(int, mystruct_t, method_name, self); 
		ASYNC_END(0); 
	}

	void mystruct_init(struct mystruct *self, const char *str){
		ASYNC_INIT(&self->method_name); 
		ASYNC_PROCESS_INIT(&self->process, mystruct_process); 
		ASYNC_QUEUE_WORK(&ASYNC_GLOBAL_QUEUE, &self->process); 
		self->str = str; 
	}

	int main(){
		struct mystruct my_struct; 
		mystruct_init(&my_struct, "Hello World!\n"); 
		
		// run the queue until all tasks are done
		while(ASYNC_RUN_PARALLEL(&ASYNC_GLOBAL_QUEUE)); 
		
		return 0; 
	}
	
Properties of async methods: 
	
* They have built in protection against being called from more than one other async method at a time (it is usually the case that you want an async method to complete before another caller can call it)
* They can not have local variables (due to jumps inside the method which will cause undefined behaviour if local variabels are present between ASYNC_BEGIN and ASYNC_END
* They can take multiple calls to complete (just use AWAIT_TASK() to asynchronously wait for a task to complete). 

Locking and types of protection
-------------------------------

Even though async methods are all running inside the same thread, the main program thread, we still encounter similar problems with concurrent data access as we do with normal threads. The only difference is that our concurrency problems only occur if thread needs to ensure that data does not change once it yields and then is resumed again. 

Async includes several built in methods for handling this: 

* Async mutex: declare async_mutex_t, init it using ASYNC_MUTEX_INIT(&mutex, 1); Then use it in a task like this: ASYNC_MUTEX_LOCK(&mutex); 
* Keeping track of parent: all tasks get a parameter called parent which points to the struct async_task of the calling task. You can save this parameter in your structure and use it to limit access to only one caller at a time. 

Stackless threads have been chosen because they are the most lightweight kind of threads available and they have very small overhead. There are however both advantages and also some disadvantages to using stackless protothreads. 

Advantages of stackless protothreads: 

- Allow device drivers to be written such that no CPU cycles are ever wasted waiting for I/O. The device driver can simply return control to the application and wait until the next time it has the chance to run. 
- Writing asynchronous tasks becomes a lot easier because they can be written linearly instead of being organized as a complicated state machine. 
- No thread is ever interrupted while it is in the middle of some operation. Threads always run to completion. Meaning that we can design our code without having to think about byte level synchronization (device level syncrhonization is required though). 
- No stack also means that we never run out of stack space inside a thread. 
- Context switching is very fast - current thread method saves it's resume point, returns to libk scheduler, libk scheduler loads the address of the next thread function to run, and calls it. 
- Not a problem to have tens of threads for each asynchronous action. Since threads are just normal methods minus the stack, we can have many threads without experiencing significant slowdown. 
- Synchronization is much easier because all code that you "see" is atomic until it explicitly releases control to the scheduler. We thus do not have to worry about non atomic memory access. 

Disadvantages of this approach: 

- Stackless means that no variable on the thread method stack is valid after a thread returns and then resumes again. Although we can easily solve this by maintaining the context inside a separate object to which the thread is attached. 
- No preemption also means that a thread can keep CPU to itself for as long as it wishes. It is up to the programmer to release the CPU as quickly as possible. Since device drivers usually use interrupt requests to respond in realtime anyway, this limitation has not proven to be a problem so far. 
- No thread can ever call another thread or spawn a new thread. Threads are only single level. All other code called from inside the thread can be considered to execute atomically (except for when it is interrupted by an ISR). 
- Data that needs to be saved across multiple thread switches must be stored in memory (this is a problem with all multitasking though). 
- Longer response times for tasks - a task can lose cpu for as long as it takes the heavies task to finish. This is solved by programmer explicitly designing threads such that control is periodically released to the scheduler. 

A detailed evaluation of libk threading
--------------------------------------

Stackless threads in libk are designed to solve one specific problem: busy waits. I settled for this approach because it has been the most lightweight solution to this problem. Almost 98% of all embedded code uses busy waits - the standard way to solve this problem is by implementing a scheduler that is able to interrupt a currently running task in the middle of it's busy loop and switch to a different task. This however also comes with a lot of subtle problems that result in much more synchronization code all around the application to ensure atomic access to shared data. 

With protothreads, it is instead possible to minimize the amount of locking and synchronization necessary, while at the same time to enjoy a healthy degree of multitasking where CPU rarely is just idly spinning inside some delay loop.

The main area where this kind of multitasking really is useful is device drivers that do a lot of I/O. I/O operations are by far the greatest bottleneck in most embedded systems that don't use multitasking and instead resort to idly waiting for an I/O operation to complete. LibK solves this problem by doing minimal caching of data and also by never waiting for an I/O operation to complete and instead letting another task run while I/O is in progress. 

Another attractive feature of libk threading is that it is completely implemented in software - meaning that it will work the same on all hardware. It is after all just an array of "update" methods that the kernel schedules periodically. 

I have found that I could improve performance with protothreading almost 100x. When I eliminated all busy delay loops in the device drivers I have found that my application was able to run a lot faster and also it has become much more responsive. I have not howerver noticed a significant memory overhead. By far the main memory overhead (which is also a necessary evil) is caching data in memory so that it can be retained while another thread has control of the CPU. Most drivers use caching in one way or another. 

IO operations in libk
---------------------

All io operations in libk are derived from the io_device subsystem. This means that all io operations are asynchronous and should therefore only be called from within a protothread. So whenever you need to do some io, you also must always have a task running that will process the io for you. All IO operations must also return into the main scheduler. This means that the following will not work: 

    while(!io_write(dev, timeout, buffer, size)); // blocking loop
    
Instead one needs to do this: 

    PT_ASYNC_WRITE(pt, dev, timeout, buffer, size); 
    
Inside a context of a protothread. 

Asynchronous IO for embedded systems
------------------------------------

Asynchronous io is nearly always a bit cumbersome to implement. It nearly always results in a more complicated program and in nearly all cases it requires the program to be structured as a state machine. When all IO operations are non blocking, the program needs to be structured in such a way that it can both wait for the io operation to complete and also to be able to do other things while it is waiting for the io operation to complete. If the system was multithreaded and blocking, we could easily just have the operating system put the process to sleep and then awaken it when io is ready. But in the perfect world we want to have many processes in the same application that never block the rest of the application while they are waiting for io. For this we need something else. Unfortunately there is no way we can escape structuring the program as a state machine. But we can do so in the most syntactically pleasant way. 

If all io operations maintain internal state over the curse of multiple calls, we can also say that each function that does io is also a state machine that cycles through a number of states while it starts and waits for different io operations to complete. We can hide this fact from the programmer by writing a set of clever macros that will make it easier for us to implement the methods that need to cycle through several states. Luckily this has already been written and it is best known as protothreads. 

Protothreads are just a set of macros that make it easier to write switch/case state machines that always cycle from one state to the next in a sequence. It is like async.each_series() in jquery. With protothreads we can structure multiple asynchronous operations in a sequence and hide all of the switch/case logic behind the scenes. 

But this is not just a good way to structure individual methods - it also makes it possible to write hierarchies of these state machine methods. This is particularly useful in the context of doing io because we usually have many io operations that call other io operations that call even more io operations. And all of these io operations are asynchronous so without protothreads it would be a nightmare to write such io code. But with protothreads we can make this work very simple. 

ASYNC/AWAIT pattern in C and C++
--------------------------------

The async/await pattern allows methods to be asynchronous and take arbitrary number of frames to execute. This is extremely useful when programming something that changes over time - for example if we need to animate some object over a number of frames. 

Unfortunately async/await is not natively supported (yet) in C and C++, but we can get away with simulating this behavior using address labels feature which allows us to jump to an arbitrary location inside a method. 

Limitations of async methods
----------------------------

Asynchronous methods have several limitations though: 

* They can not declare any local variables - all variables have to be part of the async context that is stored elsewhere and has a lifetime longer than the scope of the method itself. This is quite natural, since async methods return and resume multiple times.
* An async method starts from the top the first time it is called, then goes to the bottom (if it can) and once it finishes it resumes at the top again. We can also have methods that never finish and instead run in a loop. This is perfectly fine as well since we can easily jump into a loop using the address labels technique. 

ASYNChronous programming in C and C++
------------------------------------

If you want to take advantage of asynchronous paradigms in C and C++ then most of the time you are out of luck because these languages have not been designed with asynchronicity in mind from the start (although there are currently talks about including async facilities into the language itself and there are boost libraries like boost asio that allow some degree of asynchronicity) but what I'm about to show you is a method that I have developed for writing complete applications in asynchronous manner which works the same way in both C and C++ (with extra faculties specifically designed for having C++ member methods as async threads). 

The method is based on the concept of protothreads that has been developed earlier, but I have fixed several shortcomings of the original pt library and added many new features and most importantly I have made it possible to safely write nested protothread code that was not possible with protothreads due to lack of built in protection against multiple threads accessing the same code at the same time. I have found that with original PT code it was very hard to achieve predictability even when using the supplied mutex library. What was needed is awareness of the calling thread in order to restrict access to only one caller at a time. This has been a big addition to the ASYNC/AWAIT library that makes it possible to have nested calls to other async tasks without having to supply a context (which was unsafe). 

The new async/await library adds following on top of protothreads concept: 
- Ability to call AWAIT_TASK(any_async_method) from multiple threads at the same time without worrying about corrupt data inside the task that we await. 
- Ability to have async methods as members of a class
- Ability to automatically register all global async methods and call them at each frame using round robin scheduling. 

What is it that we are trying to do?
-----------------------------------

What I wanted to do was this: I wanted to implement an asynchronous IO framework that would work in small embedded chips and would consume minimal resources. I wanted it to be possible to have several async methods that worked on the same object and I wanted to avoid having to pass a context to each of the methods that it was to work on. The context associated with a thread is the same every time in async/await. It is bound to the actual async method and not to the caller. This makes it possible for us to have methods that will always run to completion. The original PT library forced us to pass an initialized context to a thread we wanted to "spawn" and this led to problem that threads were never guaranteed to run to completion. In async/await, instead of having the concept of "spawning" threads we have the concept of calling async methods and awaiting their completion. I have thus also removed the unnecessary thread states and replaced them with just two: waiting and running. 

Thinking of the protothreads as "asynchronous methods" is a lot more productive than to think about them as threads. After all, they are not real threads, but instead they are ordinary methods that may take multiple calls to complete. Thus we have the "await" concept that provides means of waiting for an asynchronous method to run to completion. Furthermore, when an async method runs to completion, it always restarts from the top. So the next call to the method will start it up from the top again so that it can enter a new cycle of asynchronous operations that it may internally need to wait for. Normally asynchronous methods take more than one call to complete. The caller also needs to provide the same arguments from the first call and until the call that returns ASYNC_ENDED value signaling that the method is done running. This is how asynchronous methods work. You pass the same arguments, call it several times and then continue with next task once it has completed running. 

I have also provided facilities for specifically allowing async methods to be called from other async methods without the danger of two calls happening at the same time. One important property that has been added to each async method is exclusivity to only one caller. This means that when an async method calls another async method for the first time, the other method will only continue running when subsequent calls come from the same caller until it completes. Once it complets, it can respond to a call from another caller. While it is busy, to all other callers it will appear as busy so they will keep calling it repeatedly and once it is done processing one caller, it will accept call from another caller and block everybody else. So we get the effect of a queue of callers without wasting any resources because the queue is implicit. Current implementation only requires each async method to save it's caller before resuming itself, and if the caller is not the same as the caller it is currently processing then it will exit even before resuming it's operation. This gives us complete protection against multiple callers running the async method at the same time. 

Asynchronous IO library
-----------------------

The best way to show how this concept works in practice is to show you a concrete implementation of asyncrhonous IO. This implementation is part of libk and libk has been refactored to only use async io. So all communication with peripherals in libk is asyncrhonous. This means that all io is non blocking. And also all operations are cooperative, which greatly simplifies non-io code (although when some io code is asyncrhonous, all io code has to be asynchronous as well). 

The async io library presupposes that all io devices are readable, writable, seekable (to a degree) and controllable (ioctl), as well as "openable" and "closable". 

The original PT implementation
------------------------------

The original PT library provided us with easy means of structuring asyncrhonous code in the form of state machine. It had two methods of doing this: one with switch/case statements and one using address labels (address labels does not compile with -pedantic flag so it is not very "standard" feature but works much better than switch/case). 

It had however several shortcomings: 

Lack of protection

When you wanted to spawn a thread, you had to create a local context (struct pt) and then initialize it and pass it repeatedly to the thread function. This was all fine, until you had threads that depended on a context (which is almost always the case in object oriented code), and when you then spawned the thread from another thread A, it would modify the state of it's object and if you then spawned it again from thread B before thread A was done with it, you had it run from the top and overwrite the changes made by the instance spawned from thread A. 

This was very inconvenient. Because as you may already know, protothreads must store their state in an object that you repeatedly pass into the thread. So having protothreads that are reentrant also requires that you have a unique object that contains data that the protothread uses and that you never share that object with other threads. 

One may instantly think "well I will just put a mutex around shared data and be done with it" but it is not that simple with protothreads because even if a thread can check the lock when it first starts running (the check must be between ASYNC_BEGIN() and ASYNC_END()), it will happily jump over that check next time because we are passing a different context. 

Work queues
------------

In contrast with AWAIT_TASK() work queues can be used to wait for multiple tasks that are all running in parallel. When we await for tasks in series, they all have to run in series, but the biggest benefit of async comes from being able to run things in parallel. And in fact, if the hardware allows things to happen simultaneously (such as for example i2c transfer and spi transfer can be happening in parallel) this setup will automatically take advantage of this fact and you can then do things truly in parallel. 

You applicaiton though only needs to care about constructing a work queue of tasks that need to run in parallel and then execute that queue. 

	// we use ASYNC_QUEUE() macro to define a static async queue
	ASYNC_QUEUE(queue)
	
An async queue maintains a list of async_process instances that we can link into the async queue.
